    <!-- ## What are Inline Elements? 

    Ans: - Inline elements do not start on a new line and only
    take up as much width as necessary. -->

    <!-- ## What are Block-level Elements?
    
    Ans: - Block-level elements are those that start on a new line and take up the entire width of their container by default. They essentially claim all the horizontal space for themselves,  pushing any content that comes after them to a new line
