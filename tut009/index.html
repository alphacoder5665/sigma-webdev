    ## What is an ID?
    An ID is an attribute, a unique identifier assigned to only one
    HTML element within a page. It is often used for unique styling
    and JavaScript manipulations. IDs are defined with the `id` attribute in HTML.
    An ID must be unique within a page, meaning no two elements can have the same ID. 
    -->

    <!-- ## What are Classes?
    The class attribute lets you give the same name to multiple HTML elements.
    That way, you can easily change their look or behavior all at once. Classes are not
    unique and can be assigned to multiple elements. They are generally used for applying
    the same styles or behaviors to a group of elements. Classes are defined with the `class` attribute in HTML.
    Classes can be reused across multiple elements, allowing for more flexible styling and behavior.
